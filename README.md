# rock-paper-scissors
Javascript project 1 for The Odin Project Foundations course. It was a fun project. I didn't do it exactly how they recommended because I have a bit of CSS/HTML knowledge from previous education. This lead me to make it more interactive. It was interesting using javascript for the first time to compete a project. Coming from Java I found it to be very similar but also easier. Hoping to dive deeper into the language as I continue down this path. Also try not to judge the styling too much. Didn't put a ton of though into the visual aspect more so focused on the buttons and interactive parts.
